## Paragraphs
There are two ways to separate paragraphs in Markdown: _soft breaks_ and _hard breaks_.

Hard breaks have empty lines in between the paragraphs and are written in Markdown the same way they are displayed.  
A hard break can be written like:
```
Paragraph 1

Paragraph 2

Paragraph 3
```
The output will be:

Paragraph 1

Paragraph 2

Paragraph 3

Soft breaks don't have the empty lines between the paragraphs. These are written by placing two spaces at the end of each paragraph.  
A soft break can be written like:
```
Paragraph 1**
Paragraph 2**
Paragraph 3**
```
(The ** represents double spaces)

The output will be:  
Paragraph 1  
Paragraph 2  
Paragraph 3  

Without including the spaces at the end and separating your paragraphs by clicking `Enter`, the paragraph separation will not be visible in the output.
```
Paragraph 1
Paragraph 2
Paragraph 3
```
Will output as:  
Paragraph 1
Paragraph 2
Paragraph 3
