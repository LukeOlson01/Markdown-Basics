## Headers
When writing documents, you probably want a header at the top of the document, and possibly have other headers throughout the document. Headers come in six sizes with 1 being the largest and 6 being the smallest. To write a header, place hash marks `#` in front of the header content. The amount of hash marks placed is equal to the header size. Be sure to place a space between the hash mark and the header content.

Headers can be written like this:
```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```
 And the output will look like this:
 # Header 1
 ## Header 2
 ### Header 3
 #### Header 4
 ##### Header 5
 ###### Header 6
