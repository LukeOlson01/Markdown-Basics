## Additional Syntax
Here are a few more things you can do to change the display of text in Markdown.

Horizontal lines can be created using triple underscores `___`, triple dashes `---`, or triple asterisks `***`  
Horizontal lines look like this:
___

*Italic text* can be created by surrounding text by single underscores or single asterisks.  
Ex: `*Italic text*` or `_Italic text_`

**Bold text** can be created by surrounding text by double underscores or double asterisks.  
Ex: `**Bold text**` or `__Bold text__`

~~Strikethrough text~~ can be created by surrounding text by double tildes.  
Ex: `~~Strikethrough text~~`

Blockquotes can be created using `>`.  
Ex:
```
>Blockquote line 1  
 Blockquote line 2  
 Blockquote line 3
```
This will output:

>Blockquote line 1  
 Blockquote line 2  
 Blockquote line 3
 
`Inline code` can be written by surrounding text with backticks  
Ex: ``` `Inline code` ```

Multiple lines of code can be written using triple backticks
